# XYZ Reader Project

## What this project was about 

### You will improve an app for this project:

    XYZ Reader: A mock RSS feed reader featuring banner photos and headlines. Download the code here.

The app is currently functional, and work in most cases for most users.

Your job will be to take the user feedback in the UI Review node, and implement changes that will improve the UI and make it conform to Material Design.

## What I have done

* Modified the color scheme and styles
* Added a coordinator layout
* Added an AppBar layout linked to the cooridinator layout
* refactored the classes to work with the new layou and views
